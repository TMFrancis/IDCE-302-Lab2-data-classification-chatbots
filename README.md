# Lab 2 - Data Classification & Chatbots
- Name:Tom Francis
- Date created:10 September 2020
- Description: Lab 2 involves two scripts: one that classifies input data and one that acts as a chatbot. Both scripts imploy input, is, elif and else statements. They use text and numeric inputs.

Script 1: asks user for current temperature and characterizes it as hot, warm, cool or cold. Input: temperature. Output: short sentence characterizing temperature in one of four categories.

Script 2: a chatbot asks user for name and 'engages' the user in a short exchange about time. The chatbot 
recognizes IDCE302 professor and teaching assistant by name and proceeds to a more general
chat if the name is not recognized. Input: name; years at sea. Output: greetings, characterizing years at sea as one of two categories

Difficulties: as with Lab 1, my main challenge was navigating GitHub and editing the private repositories.
